## Current Documentation

All content from these files has been consolidated, reorganized, and deduplicated in:

**`/mock-idp/README.md`** - Single comprehensive documentation (25KB)

The main README.md now serves as the single source of truth for the mock-idp project, containing all essential information in a well-organized, non-redundant format.

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files are kept for reference purposes but are no longer actively maintained. They contained:
- Redundant explanations of the same concepts
- Overlapping sections between files
- Verbose repetitions of information

The new consolidated README.md provides:
- All unique technical information preserved
- Clear hierarchy and table of contents
- Eliminated redundancies
- Better organization and navigation
- Single source of truth
